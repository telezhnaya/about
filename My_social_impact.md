Many companies prefer one-page CV, so I decided to move all my social impact to separate link. You could upload full version of my CV [here](https://github.com/telezhnaya/about/raw/master/Telezhnaia-cv.pdf). Some of the links in the text below are only in Russian, I am so sorry for that. Please use the translator.

## Before the start: why am I doing this?

Start of my career was not easy. I grew up in a traditional family, and my parents were sure that the girl can't learn STEM well. I loved Math at elementary school, but anyway they put me at linguistics school, then they advised me to go to linguistics University, and I even passed all the exams, but finally I decided to change my life dramatically. 

Now I am Software Engineer, and I am proud of it. I am trying to help other newbies, regardless of age, to start their journey into programming. I focus on helping women because I want to fight with sexist stereotypes which influenced my life so heavily.

## My social activities

### I am the organizer of [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/)

I made 2 events in [Saint Petersburg](https://djangogirls.org/stpetersburg/), coached 3 new organizers and nearly 25 mentors, now I am in the progress of launching first Django Girls workshop in Kazan. 

Nearly 120 women started their journey in technologies after my workshops. Read some articles about us [[1]](http://klever.blog/olya-telezhnaya-django-girls/) [[2]](http://klever.blog/django-girls-experience/) [[3]](http://luna-info.ru/discourse/django-girls/), our alumni just has found a job and written [great article in English](https://dev.to/patiencedaur/my-first-job-interview-the-power-of-friendship-33h0).

### I am the organizer of [PyLadies](https://spb.pyladies.com/)

### I am the mentor in [GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) in [Git project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6477677521797120)

As you could know from my CV, I am active contributor to [Git](https://github.com/git/git/commits?author=telezhnaya). I started from [Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/), then I decided to continue my work for free. I was at the [Contributors Summit](https://git-merge.com/) twice, and now I am mentoring one of the students. I suggested projects for the students, made descriptions, chose students for the internship. All this summer I am fully into the task of my student to make Git parallel: I review their code and think how else can I help them.

### I am the author of [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/programming_together/)

My videos help other people to get into technologies. I do not have exact numbers, but letters in my public email said that 3 people entered technical University and 2 other women were selected to GSoC/Outreachy internship after watching my videos.

### I am the reviewer of [technology books](https://dmkpress.com/catalog/computer/)

I am reviewing books about technologies, writing proposals, editing translation, editing code examples so that my colleagues or studens or children (who does not know English still) could enjoy STEM books in Russian from around the world.

### I was the tutor in Math and Programming for more than 5 years

### I participate in conferences as much as I can

I took part in a big collection of Microsoft events, big bunch of Python Conferences, Hacktoberfest and many other cool activities.

![Badges from the conferences that I could find](https://pp.userapi.com/c851532/v851532237/12d50b/27Pq4lYFj9E.jpg)

This winter I passed the algorythmic contest [Google Code Jam to I/O](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejamio) and won the ticket to [Google IO](https://events.google.com/io/).
