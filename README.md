## FAQ

### Telezhnaya or Telezhnaia?
Sounds the same.
I prefer to use the first option (as you could see in my nickname everywhere), but Russian government insist on the second one.
I need to be careful working with legal documents.

### Olga or Olya?
In Russian, first one is official, while second one is casual one.
It's usually hard to pronounce `Olya` for people who do not speak Russian, so choose to your taste.
Please do not write `Olia`, it looks awful and even Russian government will not push me to use this option.

### What was before tech University?
As you could see, I did not win any programming competitions while I was at school, and that's not because I am shy or because I have no space in my CV for that (I have).
I was learning at linguistic school, and I even entered linguistic University (I should have studied ancient Greek language).
I decided to change my life dramatically and try to learn STEM.
That was one of the best decisions in my life.

### Wow! Do you have another work experience, apart from programming?
Yes.
I was working as the babysitter for more than 6 years.
I also was shopping consultant in smartphone store.
I registered SIM cards for half a year.
I was selling smart toys (magnets, boarding games, unicycles etc.) before I joined University because I wanted to learn juggling (and I succeed in it).
I was working in my first courses at University, I taught Math and Programming.
After University, I was Technical Evangelist (and it's easier to say that I am feeding unicorns than to explain what exactly Technical Evangelist does).
I guess I can do anything, that's why I decided to work at the startup :sweat_smile:
